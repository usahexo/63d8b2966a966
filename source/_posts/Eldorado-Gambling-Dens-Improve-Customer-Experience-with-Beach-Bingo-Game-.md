"The Beach Bingo game has been a big hit with our customers," said Benny Fullerton, Marketing Manager for Eldorado Gambling Dens. "We've seen an increase in customer engagement and satisfaction since we introduced the game."

In addition to the customer benefits, Eldorado Gambling Dens also saw a significant increase in profits from Beach Bingo compared to traditional bingo games. This increase is attributed to the excitement and fun that the new game brings to players.
