#  Don't legalize athletics betting, Seattle Mariners!

In the United States, many people enjoy placing bets on sporting events. This includes major sports such as football, basketball, and baseball. While some bet on these sports through a bookie or other illegal means, others place their bets through legal means such as Las Vegas or offshore sportsbooks.

One of the most popular sports to bet on is baseball. This is especially true in states like Nevada where betting on baseball is legal. In fact, a recent study showed that 56% of all money wagered on sports in Nevada was on baseball games.

Given this popularity, it might come as a surprise that some are now calling for the legalization of athletics betting in Washington state, including at Seattle Mariners games. While this may generate additional revenue for the state, it could also have negative consequences for the team.

One potential issue is that legalized betting could increase the number of games that are bet on illegally. This would likely include bets made by fans of the opposing team, which could lead to tension and hostility at the games. It could also lead to more cheating by players in order to give their team an edge.



Another concern is that legalized betting would make it more difficult for teams like the Mariners to compete. With more money being wagered on their games, the odds would be against them even more than they already are. This could lead to teams folding and less competitive games.


Finally, there is always a risk that gambling addiction will increase if athletics betting is legalized. This could lead to financial ruin for many families and increase crime rates as people try to get their hands on money to gamble with.


In light of all these risks, I believe that athletics betting should not be legalized in Washington state, including at Seattle Mariners games. The potential negative consequences outweigh any possible benefits.

#  Athletics betting would hurt Seattle Mariners!

There has been a recent proposal to legalize sports betting in the state of Washington, and if that happens, it would be terrible news for the Seattle Mariners.

Here's why...

 legalizing sports betting would lead to an increase in gambling on the Mariners games. This would create an unfair competitive advantage for teams with more "dedicated" fans who are willing to bet on their team.

 Additionally, it would be much harder for the Mariners front office to make trades or sign players, because other teams would know that they could offer more money in order to get Seattle to "give up" a player.

Finally, gambling addiction is a real problem, and it could lead many people to ruin their lives by betting on sports.

All in all, it would be a disaster if sports betting were legalized in Washington, and the Mariners should do everything they can to block this proposal from happening.

#  Keep gambling away from our Seattle Mariners!

Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to spend time with friends or family. However, as Seattle Mariners fans, we need to keep gambling away from our favorite team. There are just too many risks involved.

First and foremost, gambling can lead to financial ruin. Fans may be tempted to bet on the Mariners to win, but if they lose, they could end up losing a lot of money. This could have a negative impact on the team’s performance, as players may start playing for money instead of for the love of the game.

Second, gambling can be addictive. Fans may find themselves spending more and more time betting on games, to the point where it becomes a problem. This could lead to them neglecting their responsibilities, such as work or school.

Finally, gambling can cause fights and disagreements between friends and family members. When people bet on games together, there is always the potential for arguments over who should have made which bet or how much money should be wagered. These disputes can cause lasting damage to relationships.

As Seattle Mariners fans, we need to stay away from gambling altogether. It’s simply not worth the risks involved. Let’s stick to cheering on our team at home and enjoying some recreational gambling activities in our free time instead!

#  Why legalize athletics betting and hurt our Seattle Mariners?

The Mariners are a team that is loved by many in the Pacific Northwest. The team has a passionate fan base that is hopeful for a championship year. However, with the legalization of athletics betting, there is a real concern that the Mariners will be hurt.

The legalization of athletics betting means that people can now place bets on sporting events. This includes betting on the outcome of games, as well as on specific players or teams. The worry for the Mariners is that this new form of gambling will take away fans from the stadium. People may instead choose to place bets on games rather than watch them in person.

This could be bad news for the Mariners, as attendance at games is one of their main sources of revenue. If people are no longer coming to see the games in person, this will have a negative impact on the team’s bottom line. Not only could it reduce ticket sales, but it could also lead to lower sponsorship and broadcast revenue.

It is important to note that legalizing athletics betting will not have a negative impact on every team. In fact, some teams may benefit from it. For example, teams that are considered underdog underdogs may see an increase in attendance as people place bets on them. However, this is not likely to be the case for the Mariners.

#  No to legalized athletics betting, it will kill the Seattle Mariners!

Athletics betting will inevitably change the game. Players could lose focus and motivation if they think they’re playing for money, not the fans. The sport of baseball will suffer because of it. Just look at what happened to the Seattle Mariners after they legalized casinos in Washington State – their attendance and profits plummeted!

The Mariners are a classic example of how legalizing athletics betting can kill a team’s fan base. Prior to the legalization of casinos in Washington State, the Mariners were one of the top teams in terms of attendance and profits. However, once casinos were legalized, their profits plummeted as people shifted their gambling money to casinos. The Mariners went from almost averaging 3 million fans a year to below 2 million within just a few years after legalizing casinos.

Baseball is a sport that’s heavily reliant on its fan base. With less people coming to games, the teams have less money to spend on players, making it harder for them to win games and attract new fans. This cycle will only continue if athletics betting is legalized – teams will become worse and worse, causing even more people to lose interest in them.

 Legalized athletics betting is not only bad for baseball, but also for society as a whole. Gambling can be addictive and lead to many social problems. It ruins lives, families, and communities. Not only that, but it also increases crime rates as people turn to criminal activities in order to make money to gamble with.

Legalizing athletics betting would be a mistake that we would all come to regret. Let’s keep our sports innocent and let the players play for the love of the game, not for money.
