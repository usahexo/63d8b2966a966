#  Taxman Hunts Gambling Winnings Tax Dodgers

The Treasury Department is stepping up its effort to collect taxes on gambling winnings, sending letters to about 1,600 casino and racetrack customers in 16 states urging them to pay up.

The letters, which began going out last week, say the recipients may have underreported their gambling income and owe back taxes, penalties and interest. The department said it is focusing on those who “appear to have failed to report income from gambling in a diligent manner.”

The move comes as the department steps up its efforts to collect all taxes owed. In February, it announced that it was increasing its audit staff for high-net-worth individuals by nearly 50 percent.

Taxpayers are required to report gambling income on their tax returns if they receive a Form W-2G, which reports winnings of more than $600. But the government believes many taxpayers do not report all of their winnings, especially if they gamble online or at tribal casinos where there is no record of their winnings.

The letters ask the taxpayers to review their tax returns and contact the department if they have any questions or need help filing amended returns. They also offer an estimate of how much the taxpayers may owe.

#  £1m Gambling Winnings Tax Dodger Fined

In a landmark case, a UK gambler who failed to pay tax on £1m of gambling winnings has been hit with a £100,000 fine.

The gambler, who is unnamed for legal reasons, had won the money through online betting but failed to report it to HMRC. In addition to the fine, he has also been ordered to pay back the full amount of tax that is owed.

This case sets a clear message that gambling winnings will not be tolerated as taxable income in the UK. It is hoped that this will encourage more people to disclose their gambling winnings, rather than attempting to dodge taxes.

HMRC has been increasingly clamping down on tax dodgers in recent years, and this latest case demonstrates that they are serious about collecting what is owed. Anyone who fails to declare their gambling winnings can expect to face similar penalties.

#  Gambling Winnings Tax Avoidance Scheme Busted

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has announced that it has busted a major gambling winnings tax avoidance scheme.

The scheme involved players deliberately losing money at casinos in order to reduce their taxable income.

The ATO estimates that the scheme cost the government around $105 million in revenue over a three-year period.

In a statement, ATO Deputy Commissioner Michael Cranston said that the scheme was "an insult to honest taxpayers".

"This type of behaviour is not tolerated and we will take action against those who try to get around the law," he said.

A number of individuals have already been arrested and charged as part of the investigation.

#  HMRC Clamp Down on Gambling Tax Evaders

HMRC is stepping up its clamp down on tax evasion by those involved in gambling. A recent operation by the department yielded £1 million in unpaid taxes from gamblers and bookmakers.

The gambling industry is notoriously difficult to legislate for, as it can be difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal activities. However, HMRC has been increasingly targeting those who attempt to evade tax on their gambling profits.

In the latest crackdown, which took place in October 2017, HMRC audited over 240 businesses and individuals involved in gambling. As a result, they collected over £1 million in unpaid taxes from gamblers and bookmakers.

 Daryl Williams, Director of HMRC’s Fraud Investigation Service, said: “This operation shows that we are determined to target the minority of people who think they can cheat the system and avoid paying their fair share of tax.”

Williams added that anyone involved in tax evasion would be targeted and brought to justice. HMRC has recently stepped up its efforts to tackle various forms of tax evasion, including offshore tax avoidance and VAT fraud.

The recent crackdown on gambling tax evaders is part of a wider effort by HMRC to make sure everyone pays their fair share of tax. The department has vowed to recover an extra £7 billion from tax evaders by 2022.

#  New Measures to Combat Gambling Tax Evasion

A number of new measures have been announced by the finance ministry in a bid to crackdown on gambling tax evasion. The government is looking to clamp down on illegal operators who are not paying their fair share of taxes.

One of the new measures includes a requirement for online casinos to hold a licence from the French tax authorities. This will allow the authorities to track and monitor gambling activity more closely. In addition, online casinos will be required to pay taxes on their profits.

Another new measure is the introduction of a black list of unlicensed online casinos. This list will be made available to French players, who will be warned not to gamble at these sites. The government is also planning to step up its enforcement efforts, with more raids and prosecutions of illegal operators.

These new measures come amid reports that the government is losing billions of euros in revenue due to tax evasion by gambling operators. The finance ministry has pledged to take steps to address this problem, and it is hoped that the new measures will help to reduce the level of tax evasion.
