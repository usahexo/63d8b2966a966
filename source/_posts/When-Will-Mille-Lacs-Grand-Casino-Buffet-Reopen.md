#  When Will Mille Lacs Grand Casino Buffet Reopen?

The question on everyone’s mind is when will the Mille Lacs Grand Casino Buffet reopen? The buffet closed abruptly on November 2nd and left customers frustrated and hungry.

Mille Lacs Grand Casino issued a statement saying that the buffet would reopen on November 12th, but that date has come and gone and there’s still no word on when the buffet will actually reopen.

Many people are speculating that the buffet will never reopen, but the casino has not given any indication that this is the case. We just have to wait and see what happens.

In the meantime, those looking for a good buffet in the area can check out Mystic Lake or Treasure Island. Both of these buffets are much better than the one at Mille Lacs Grand Casino, so you won’t be missing out too much.
