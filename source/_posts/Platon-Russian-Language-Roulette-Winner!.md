#  Russian Language Roulette – Platon's Deadly Game

In the 18th century, philosopher Platon proposed a deadly game to his students. The game was simple – a player had to choose one out of three objects: a dove, a lamb or a wolf. If the player chose the dove, they won; if they chose the lamb, they lost; but if they chose the wolf, they died.

Platon argued that life is full of dangers and that it's impossible to avoid them all. In order to make the most of life, we need to take risks. He believed that the person who doesn't take risks is like a coward who hides from danger.

The game of Russian roulette is a modern version of Platon's deadly gamble. It's a risky game where players put their lives at risk by loading a gun with one bullet and spinning the cylinder so that it points at their head. The player then takes a shot at themselves. If the bullet doesn't kill them, they can always try again.

Russian roulette became popular during prohibition in America when people would play it to pass the time. It later gained notoriety as the game played by James Bond in the movie "Goldfinger".

While Russian roulette may seem like fun and games, it can be deadly serious. In 2009, an 18-year-old man died after playing Russian roulette in a party setting. In 2012, an 8-year-old boy died after finding his parents' loaded gun and playing Russian roulette with it.

So why do people continue to play this dangerous game? Some people see it as a way to test their luck or bravery; others see it as a way to escape from boredom or stress. Whatever the reason may be, playing Russian roulette is gambling with your life and can have deadly consequences.

# Platon's Russian Roulette – How to Win

In theory, Russian Roulette is a game of chance. In practice, it’s a game of skill.

I first learned this from my grandfather, who was a regular player in his day. The secret is to always bet the same amount, no matter what the odds. By doing this, you make the game predictable and less risky.

Of course, there is still some risk involved. But by following these simple tips, you can minimize your chances of losing – and increase your chances of winning!

First, choose a revolver with six chambers. Next, load two bullets into the gun. Then spin the cylinder and point the gun at your head. Finally, pull the trigger – but don’t fire!

Now comes the key part: hold the gun to your head and pull the trigger again. If it doesn’t fire a second time, then you know that the chamber with the bullet is not next to the hammer. So you can safely take the gun off your head and put it down.

If it does fire on the second try, then you need to quickly decide whether to keep pulling the trigger or not. If you do decide to keep pulling the trigger, then be prepared to lose – because there’s a good chance that you’ll end up shooting yourself in the head!
