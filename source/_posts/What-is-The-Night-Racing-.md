# How to play The Night Racing?

The Night Racing is a new kind of racing game that can be played in two different ways. In the first way, players use controllers to control cars that they see on the screen. In the second way, players use a virtual reality headset to control cars that they see in the game.

In order to play The Night Racing in the first way, players will need two controllers. One controller will be used to control the car and the other controller will be used to change the camera angle. Players can also use a keyboard and mouse instead of controllers if they want. In order to play The Night Racing in the second way, players will need a virtual reality headset like the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive.

In both ways of playing The Night Racing, there are different levels that players can race through. There are also different cars that players can choose from. In order to unlock new cars, players will need to earn coins by completing levels. Coins can also be used to buy upgrades for cars.

There are three different types of levels in The Night Racing: standard, stunt, and time trial. Standard levels are just like regular races where players try to finish first. Stunt levels involve doing stunts such as jumping over obstacles or driving on two wheels for a certain amount of time. Time trial levels are races where players have to complete the level as quickly as possible.
