        <h1 id="Angels-Announce-Major-Reno-Casino-Partnership"><a href="#Angels-Announce-Major-Reno-Casino-Partnership" class="headerlink" title="Angels Announce Major Reno Casino Partnership"></a>Angels Announce Major Reno Casino Partnership</h1><p>The Reno Angels, a professional baseball team, announced a major partnership with the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa on Wednesday. The partnership is reported to be worth $10 million and will see the casino become the team’s exclusive casino partner for the next five years.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the agreement, the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa will receive prominent branding at Greater Nevada Field, the home of the Reno Angels. The casino will also have exclusive rights to offer casino games at the stadium, as well as promotional opportunities with the team.</p>
<p>Tim Von Werne, CEO of the Reno Angels, said that he was excited about the new partnership. “Atlas has been a great partner of ours for a long time and we are thrilled to extend that relationship into our new stadium and beyond,” he said.</p>
<p>The Atlantis Casino Resort Spa has been involved with the Reno Angels for several years already. In addition to becoming an exclusive partner this season, the casino has been a presenting sponsor of the team since 2013.</p>
<p>In a statement, John Lepore, CEO of the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa, said that he was pleased to continue his company’s partnership with the Reno Angels. “Our sponsorship of the Reno Angels allows us to engage with our guests in unique and fun ways while providing added value to their experience at Greater Nevada Field,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Los-Angeles-Angels-and-Reno-Casino-Partner-to-Take-on-MLB"><a href="#Los-Angeles-Angels-and-Reno-Casino-Partner-to-Take-on-MLB" class="headerlink" title="Los Angeles Angels and Reno Casino Partner to Take on MLB"></a>Los Angeles Angels and Reno Casino Partner to Take on MLB</h1><p>The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the Reno casino have partnered up in an attempt to take on Major League Baseball. The strategy for Reno is to create a new, “integrated entertainment and sports complex” that will house the Angels and their affiliate, the Triple-A Reno Aces.</p>
<p>Reno’s mayor, Hillary Schieve, has been a big proponent of the deal and is confident that it will bring more jobs and money to her city. She commented on the partnership, saying that it was a “win-win for both parties”.</p>
<p>The Angels are in the process of finding a new home because their current stadium, Angel Stadium of Anaheim, is dated and unable to generate as much revenue as modern stadiums can. The team’s president, John Carpino, stated that they were looking for a stadium with “concessions, gaming, retail and family-entertainment opportunities”.</p>
<p>Reno’s new stadium is set to be completed in 2020 and will cost $350 million. The complex will also include a hotel, convention center, and other forms of entertainment. It’s expected to create over 3,000 jobs for the area.</p>

The Nevada based baseball club has agreed to relocate their Triple-A operations to Southern California, pending league approval.</p>
<p>Reno Aces President &amp; CEO Eric Edelstein had this to say, “This is an exciting day for the Aces organization. We are looking forward to moving our team to a first-class facility and providing our fans in Southern California the best AAA experience possible.”</p>
<p>A press conference is scheduled for Thursday, January 12th at 10:00am PT in which more details about the move will be announced.</p>
<h1 id="Reno-Casino-to-Help-Angels-Revamp-Image-Strategy"><a href="#Reno-Casino-to-Help-Angels-Revamp-Image-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Reno Casino to Help Angels Revamp Image, Strategy"></a>Reno Casino to Help Angels Revamp Image, Strategy</h1><p>Reno casino officials have decided to help the Angels revamp their image and strategy. The Angels have been struggling lately, as they have fallen to last place in their division.</p>
<p>The Reno casino has offered the team a $1 million marketing deal. In exchange, the casino will get exclusive rights to market themselves as the home of the Angels. The team will also be given access to the casino’s marketing experts, who will help them improve their marketing strategy.</p>
<p>This deal is seen as a way for both the team and the casino to improve their image. The Angels are hoping to turn their season around with the help of the Reno casino. The Reno casino is hoping to attract more customers with this deal.</p>
<p>Some people are skeptical about this deal, as they believe that it could compromise the integrity of the team. However, both sides insist that there is no connection between the two organizations beyond this marketing deal.</p>
<h1 id="Angels-Plan-to-Make-a-Big-Splash-in-the-Reno-Casino"><a href="#Angels-Plan-to-Make-a-Big-Splash-in-the-Reno-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Angels Plan to Make a Big Splash in the Reno Casino"></a>Angels Plan to Make a Big Splash in the Reno Casino</h1><p>The Reno casino is a hub for entertainment and excitement. It has something for everyone, from slots and table games to concerts and shows. However, the casino could be even better if it had an angel investor.</p>
<p>Angels are individuals who invest in a business with the hope of making a return on their investment. In addition to the financial return, angels can provide valuable guidance and mentorship to help businesses grow.</p>
<p>The Reno casino is no exception. With the help of an angel investor, the casino could expand its operations and improve its customer experience.</p>
<p>One potential angel investor is Jeanne Saferstein. Jeanne is a successful entrepreneur with a background in marketing and advertising. She has already invested in several businesses, including a restaurant chain and a tech company.</p>
<p>Jeanne knows what it takes to succeed in business and she is excited to help the Reno casino reach its full potential. She believes that the casino has great potential to grow and she is eager to contribute her knowledge and expertise to help make that happen.</p>
<p>The Reno casino is lucky to have Jeanne as an investor because she brings more than just money to the table. She also brings invaluable experience and advice that can help the casino reach new heights. With her support, the Reno casino is sure to become even more popular and profitable in the years to come.</p>
